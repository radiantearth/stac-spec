# STAC Commons

This folder contains parts of the specification that are shared across the Item, Catalog and Collection specifications.

## In this directory

- **[Assets](assets.md)**: Asset refers to data associated with Items or Collections that can be downloaded or streamed.
- **[Links](links.md)**: Links describe relationships with other entities, e.g. other STAC entities or external resources.
- **[Common Metadata](common-metadata.md)**: Common metadata defines commonly used fields in STAC
  that can be used in all STAC entities, e.g. Items, Collections, Catalogs, Assets, Links, Bands, etc.
  
  *Note: For backward compatibility, the JSON Schemas for common metadata are located in the
  [folder that contains the JSON Schemas for the Item specification](../item-spec/json-schema/).*
