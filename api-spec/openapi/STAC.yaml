  title: The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog API
  version: 0.8.1
  description: >-
    This is an OpenAPI definition of the core SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog API
    specification. Any service that implements this endpoint to allow search of
    spatiotemporal assets can be considered a STAC API. The endpoint is also
    available as an OpenAPI fragment that can be integrated with other OpenAPI
    definitions, and is designed to slot seamlessly into a OGC API - Features definition.

      description: >-
        Returns the root STAC Catalog or STAC Collection that is the entry point
        for users to browse with STAC Browser or for search engines to crawl.
        This can either return a single STAC Collection or more commonly a STAC
        catalog that usually lists sub-catalogs of STAC Collections, i.e. a
        simple catalog that lists all collections available through the API.

    bbox:
      description: |
        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are
        selected. The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
        depending on whether the coordinate reference system includes a
        vertical axis (elevation or depth):

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2  
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional) 
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1 
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2 
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS84
        longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless
        a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter
        `bbox-crs`.

        For WGS84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence
        of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum
        latitude. However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the
        first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value
        (east-most box edge).


        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the
        decision of the server whether only a single spatial geometry property
        is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.

        Either a date-time or an interval, open or closed. Date and time expressions
        adhere to RFC 3339. Open intervals are expressed using double-dots.

        Examples:

        * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
        * A closed interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
        * Open intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"

        Only features that have a temporal property that intersects the value of
        `datetime` are selected.

        If a feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the
        server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant temporal properties.

    summaries:
      description: >-
        Summaries are either a unique set of all available values *or* statistics. Statistics by default only specify the range (minimum and maximum values), but can optionally be accompanied by additional statistical values. The range can specify the potential range of values, but it is recommended to be as precise as possible. The set of values must contain at least one element and it is strongly recommended to list all values. It is recommended to list as many properties as reasonable so that consumers get a full overview of the Collection. Properties that are covered by the Collection specification (e.g. `providers` and `license`) may not be repeated in the summaries.

            description: >-
              By default, only ranges with a minimum and a maximum value can be specified. Ranges can be specified for ordinal values only, which means they need to have a rank order. Therefore, ranges can only be specified for numbers and some special types of strings. Examples: grades (A to F), dates or times. Implementors are free to add other derived statistical values to the object, for example `mean` or `stddev`.
