- The `license` field additionally supports SPDX expressions and the value `other`.
- The `roles` field known from Assets and Providers is available in common metadata. ([#1267](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues/1267))

### Changed

- Common Metadata:
  - Clarify in various field descriptions that the fields do not only apply to Items
  - Validate the fields also in Catalogs, Collections and Links
  - If a description is given, require that it is not empty
- Clarified that trailing slashes in URIs are significant. ([#1212](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/discussions/1212))

### Deprecated

- `license`: The values `proprietary` and `various` are deprecated in favor of SPDX expressions and `other`.

### Removed

- JSON Schemas don't allow "shortcuts" for core extensions any longer. ([#1121](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1121))
- Various examples fixes.

## [v1.0.0-rc.3] - 2021-04-29

### Added

- Summaries are allowed to specify JSON Schema in addition to ranges and sets of values. ([#1045](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues/1045))

- Overview section linking to various foundational standards. ([#1111](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1111))

### Changed

- The first extent in a Collection is always the overall extent, followed by more specific extents. ([#1064](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues/1064), [opengeospatial/ogcapi-features#520](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/pull/520))
- Updated examples for automatic collection creation from code and validation ([#1080](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1080))
- Clarified that stac_extensions should also list extensions that are used in Collection summaries. ([#1077](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues/1077))
- The Stats Object for Summaries has been renamed to Range Object (no functional change). ([#1093](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1093))
- `changed`, `created` (common metadata) and temporal extents (collections): Timestamps must be always in UTC ([#1095](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues/1095))
- Clarified that collection summaries do not require that all property fields are summarized. ([#1106](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues/1106))
- Clarified that gsd should only be used on an asset to represent the sensor, not just different processing. ([#1105](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1105))
- Clarified that leaving a field out is not equivalent to setting it as null. ([#1111](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1111))

## [v1.0.0-rc.2] - 2021-03-30

### Changed

- Required properties of type `string` require a minimum length of `1`. ([#1065](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1065))
- `gsd` must be greater than 0. ([#1068](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1068))

### Removed

- The remaining extensions in the spec (EO, Projection, Scientific Citation and View) have been moved out of the core specification, into their own repos in the [stac-extensions](https://github.com/stac-extensions/) GitHub organization. They must now be referred to by their schemas directly - the name shortcuts for them are no longer valid. The concept of the 'named shortcut' also goes away entirely. ([#1070](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1070))

### Fixed

- Examples
- Collection Assets were specified as required (only in written text, not in JSON Schema), but that was incorrectly copied over from the former `collection-assets` extension. Collection Assets are not required.
- Clarified that the values in summaries (both for ranges and sets of values) must follow the data type of the property they summarize. ([#1069](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1069))

## [v1.0.0-rc.1] - 2021-03-03

### Added

- Catalog and Collection now require a `type` parameter, to be set to `Catalog` or `Collection` for clients to more easily distinguish them easily. ([#971](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/971))
- Collection specification adds Assets (previously needed Collections Asset extension to do that). ([#1008](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1008))
- 'via' and 'canonical' rel types are now options in Items. ([#884](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/884))
- In Extensions list there is now reference to three new (non-core) extensions: [processing](https://github.com/stac-extensions/processing), [file info](https://github.com/stac-extensions/file) and [card4l](https://github.com/stac-extensions/card4l). These would have been added to the stac-spec repo, except all non-core extensions were moved to [stac-extensions](https://github.com/stac-extensions/) org. ([#1024](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1024))
- 'summaries' are now available in the Catalog spec, so both catalogs and collections can make use of it. ([#903](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues/903))
- There is a new recommendation to enable CORS. ([#940](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/940))
- A Best Practice section on 'requester pays' cloud buckets was added. ([#1021](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1021))
- A new Best Practice section explains Asset Roles, plus some lists of potential roles for people to use (in best practices, sar and eo). ([#989](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/989))
- There is a new Best Practice recommendation to keep collections at consistent levels. ([#1009](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1009))

### Changed

- The [Stats Object](collection-spec/collection-spec.md#range-object) for Collection `summaries` changed `min` to `minimum` and `max` to `maximum` to align with JSON Schema. ([#967](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/967))
- URIs (usually found int properties like `href`, `url`) are now validated using the `iri-reference` format in JSON Schema (allows international characters in URIs) ([#953](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/953))
- Enhanced the way the spec talks about ID's to encourage more global uniqueness. ([#883](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/883))
- Clarified how collection-level asset object properties do not remove the need for item-level asset object properties in the `item-assets` extension ([#880](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/880))
- Made `summaries` to be *strongly recommended* - everyone should strive to implement them, as they are very useful. ([#985](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/985))
- Moved examples from individual directories into a single /examples folder at the root, and evolved them to be more representative. ([#955](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/955))
- Renamed "Scientific Extension" to "Scientific Citation Extension" ([#990](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues/990))
- Relaxed the regular expression for DOIs in the scientific extension ([#910](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues/910))
- `proj:geometry` allows all GeoJSON geometries instead of just a polygon. ([#995](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/995))

### Removed

- Checksum extension (field `checksum:multihash`). Use File Info extension (field `file:checksum`) instead for assets. There's no replacement for links. ([#934](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/934))
- Collection Assets extension, as the core construct of Assets in a Collection is now part of the core Collection spec. No change is required except removing `collection-assets` from the list of `stac_extensions`. ([#1008](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1008))
- Numerous extensions (Data Cube, Item Assets, Point Cloud, SAR, Single File STAC, Tiled Assets, Timestamps & Versioning) have been moved out of the core specification, into their own repos in the [stac-extensions](https://github.com/stac-extensions/) GitHub organization. They must now be referred to by their schemas directly - the name shortcuts for them are no longer valid. ([#1024](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/1024))

### Fixed

- Fixed JSON Schema for `providers` (Collections and Items) to be an object and require a `name`. ([#924](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/924))

## [v1.0.0-beta.2] - 2020-07-08

### Added
- JSON-schema file in the Point Cloud extension.

### Changed
- Clarification on null geometries, making bbox not required if a null geometry is used.
- Multiple extents (bounding boxes / intervals) are allowed per Collection

- **Extension maturity**: Protocol for providing maturity classification for extensions based on stability and implementations.
- **Commons extension**: The previous 'Collections' extension is now the 'Commons' extension and allows an Item to inherit properties from its Collection.
- **Datetime-range extension**: Extension for providing start and end datetimes.
- **Scientific extension**: Extension for providings links to scientific publications relating to the data.
- **rel types**: A list of supported `rel` types are provided for use when specifying links, `derived_from` and `license` types added.
- **eo:constellation**: A new field in the EO specification to specify a grouping of platforms.
- **stac_version**: The `stac_version` field is required on all Catalogs (and Collections).
- **JSON schemas**: Added JSON schemas where they were missing.
- **Single Item extension**: Extension to supply License and Providers for single Items when no collection is used.
- **UML Diagram**: See STAC-060-uml.pdf.
- **Development Process**: See process.md for information on the STAC development process.

### Changed
- **API**: Main catalog endpoint at `/stac`, search endpoint now at `/stac/search`.
- **eo:bands**: The `eo:bands` field is now an array rather than a dictionary, and has been moved inside of `properties` in a STAC Item.
- **Catalog fields**: Catalogs have a smaller number of basic fields: `id`, `stac_version`, `title` (optional), `description`, and `links`. The new Collections type contains additional fields.
- **links**: The links fields are now an array rather than a dictionary.
- **properties**: Fields with the data type array or objects are allowed inside the `properties` in a STAC Item.
- **description**: Description fields now allow formatting with CommonMark.
- **assets**: Fields changed names: `name` to `title` and `mime_type` to `type`.

### Removed
- **provider**: Provider field in Items got removed. Use Collections or the Single Item extension instead.
- **license**: License field in Items got removed. Use Collections or the Single Item extension instead.

## [v0.5.2] - 2018-07-12

Minor bug fixes on 0.5.1 for the schema files. Thanks @francbartoli

## [v0.5.1] - 2018-07-06

Minor bug fixes from 0.5.1 release

- [Update openapi / swagger specs for new 'links'](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/commit/480d4fb02b4a7e880c7ca01320fe2773260ba595)
- [minor fixes on collection extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/124) - thanks @m-mohr
- [minor cbers example updates](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/pull/123) - thanks @fredliporace

## [v0.5.0] - 2018-07-01

The 0.5.0 release of the STAC spec is an iteration forward on the spec, with a number of core improvements. Highlights include:

- **Links is now a dictionary** - This is the most core change done. It aligns the structure with the 'asset' change in 0.5.0, making it easier for clients to look up the link that they want more easily. The schema is updated to this (and actually checks assets better now, thanks @mojodna )

- **Transactions Extension** - There is now a transaction extension for the STAC API, thanks to @hgs-msmith and @hgs-trutherford

- **Collections iterations** @matthewhanson has evolved the collections extension, adding in some namespace type hints on it, and explaining it more clearly.

- **eo:crs to eo:epsg** In the EO profile @matthewhanson brought in a change to use EPSG code, instead of full Well Known Text, to make it easy to reference.

## [v0.4.1] - 2018-04-24

A few minor improvements on the release. ([issues](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A0.4.1+))

- @hgs-msmith got a swagger version of the spec, and made some minor improvements to the openapi version #103 and #102
- @francbartoli and @m-mohr pointed out some inconsistencies with landsat, so got the openapi updated #106
- @m-mohr pointed out some issues with landsat example, so updated those #105
- @hgs-trutherford pointed out that the planet example was a bit confusing, so updated it to the EO profile.

## [v0.4.0] - 2018-04-06

The 0.4.0 is the first 'official' release of the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification!

It is the result of the [ft. collins sprint](https://github.com/radiantearth/community-sprints/tree/master/03072018-ft-collins-co), the second in person meeting of the STAC community. But it also includes
a number of improvements from remote contributors.

Highlights include:

- Updates to the core **`Item` JSON specification**, including simplifying to a single datetime, moving thumbnails from 'links' to 'assets', making assets a dictionary for easier lookup and requiring `self` links to be absolute links.

- Alignment of **STAC API** with the new [WFS3](https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/) specification

- Cleanup of the **static catalog** specification for greater clarity around the catalog

- A first cut of an **Earth Observation Profile**, as well as a new collections extension to support it.

- Numerous small improvements and bug fixes.

See the [milestone 0.4.0 in the issue tracker](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/milestone/3) for the complete lists of improvements.

Thanks @hgs-msmith, @matthewhanson, @hgs-trutherford, @rouault, @joshfix, @alkamin, @hemphillda, @jeffnaus  and @fredliporace for contributing to the spec directly, and to [everyone](https://github.com/opengeospatial/wfs3hackathon/blob/master/notes/introductions.md#participants) who participated in the [Ft Collins sprint](https://github.com/radiantearth/community-sprints/tree/master/03072018-ft-collins-co) and brought great ideas.
