  APIError:
    description: An APIError communicates both general and field-specific errors.
      General errors include issues with core API usage as well as conflicts that
      involve more than one field. Field-specific errors correspond to an individual
      query parameter or request body attribute. Errors referencing nested fields
      will be dot-delimited (e.g. user.groups.0.name).
