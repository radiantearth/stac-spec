## Overview

One of the most important aspects of the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog specification is its extensibility. The core
STAC specification defines only a minimal core, but is designed for extension. It is expected that most real-world
implementations will use several 'extensions' to fully describe their data. This document describes how extensions
work.

**For a list of most available extensions see the [STAC extensions overview page](https://stac-extensions.github.io/).**
Please note the [extension maturity](#extension-maturity) for each extension.

Extensions to the core STAC specification provide additional fields that can be used to better describe
the data. Most tend to be about describing a particular domain or type of data, but some imply
functionality.

Extensions include a JSON Schema precisely describing the structure, a natural language description of the fields, and thorough examples.

Anybody can create an extension for their data, and data providers often work together to share
fields between them to create a shared community extension. See the section below on '[Extending STAC](#extending-stac)')
for information on how to get started. Everyone is encouraged to add their extensions to the 
[STAC extensions overview page](https://stac-extensions.github.io/), so others can be aware of it.

Each extension should have at least one *owner*. You can find extension owners in each extension's README.

## Using Extensions

When deciding how to model data in STAC it is highly recommended to first look at the
[list of extensions](https://stac-extensions.github.io/) and re-use fields there instead of creating your own version.
This increases interoperability, as users know that the meaning of your fields is the same as in other STAC 
implementations. Many clients will also understand more mature extensions for better display and querying. 

To incorporate an extension in STAC the 'Identifier' of the extension must be added to the `stac_extensions`
array of the STAC [Catalog](../catalog-spec/catalog-spec.md#stac_extensions), 
[Collection](../collection-spec/collection-spec.md#stac_extensions) or [Item](../item-spec/item-spec.md#stac_extensions)
object. This identifier is a URL to the JSON Schema that allows to validate the fields in the extension.
These JSON Schema URLs also include the version number of the extension. The 'Identifier' can usually be
found in the first lines of the README of any extension made with the
[extension template](https://github.com/stac-extensions/template).

### Extension identifiers in `stac_extensions`

Generally, if an extension is implemented in a STAC file in a place where the extension scope applies to, 
the extension identifier should be added to the `stac_extension` array. The scope of an extension is usually
explained in the README of an extension. Implementing an extension by following the specified requirements usually means including 
fields, but occasionally also means implementing alternate behaviors.

There is no direct inheritance between children and parents though, so if for example an Item implements an extension,
but the Collection doesn't reflect the usage of the extension, the extension identifier must only be added to the
`stac_extension` array in the Item, but not to the Collection. If the Collection itself implements the extension though
or 'summarizies' a field in Collection Summaries or Item Asset Definitions, the extension identifier should be added to the
Collection.

**Examples**

- If the Catalog, Collection or Item object directly implements the extension,
  the `stac_extensions` of that object should contain the extension Identifier.
- If an Asset object implements an extension, the `stac_extensions` of the Item or Collection which holds that
  Asset should contain the extension identifier.
- If a Collection [summary](../collection-spec/collection-spec.md#summaries) contains Item fields that implement an extension, then
  the `stac_extensions` array of that Collection should list the extension identifier. For example, if a Collection `summaries` field
  contains a summary of `eo:bands`, then that Collection should have the EO extension JSON Schema URL in the `stac_extensions` array.
- If an object implements an extension that results in fields from a separate extension to be referenced, then the latter extension
  identifier should be included in the `stac_extensions` array for that object. For example, if a Collection implements the
  [item_assets](https://github.com/stac-extensions/item-assets) extension, and in the `item_assets` field there is an Asset Definition
  which includes `eo:bands`, then the EO extension identifier should be listed in that Collection's `stac_extensions`.

## Community Extensions

Everyone is welcome to contribute extensions to the STAC ecosystem. The center of activity for these is the
[stac-extensions GitHub organization](https://github.com/stac-extensions), which has a number of extension repositories.
Some of these, especially the [stable extensions](#extension-maturity), are observed by the STAC PSC.
The community can also host STAC extensions in other places, but we encourage the community to
at least list them in the [STAC extensions overview page](https://stac-extensions.github.io/) so that
everyone can be aware of all extensions at any time and a high level of interoperability is possible.

### Proposed extensions

Beyond the community extensions there have been a number of extensions that people have proposed to the STAC community. These
can be found in the STAC [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues) under the 
[new extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+extension%22) label.
These are ideas that others would likely use and potentially collaborate on. Anyone is free to add new
ideas there, and see the section below on [proposing new extensions](#proposing-new-extensions) for the
workflow to advance ideas into full-fledged community extensions.

## Extension Maturity

There are many extensions being built with STAC, but they have varying degrees of maturity. All community extensions
listed here included must include a maturity classification, so that STAC spec users can easily get a sense of how
much they can count on the extension.

| Maturity Classification | Min Impl # | Description                                                                                                                                                | Stability                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proposal                | 0          | An idea put forward by a community member to gather feedback                                                                                               | Not stable - breaking changes almost guaranteed as implementers try out the idea.                                                               |
| Pilot                   | 1          | Idea is fleshed out, with examples and a JSON schema, and implemented in one or more catalogs. Additional implementations encouraged to help give feedback | Approaching stability - breaking changes are not anticipated but can easily come from additional feedback.                                      |
| Candidate               | 3          | A number of implementers are using it and are standing behind it as a solid extension. User can generally count on an extension at this maturity level.    | Mostly stable, breaking changes require a new version and minor changes are unlikely. The extension has a code owner, designated in its README. |
| Stable                  | 6          | Highest current level of maturity. The community of extension maintainers commits to a STAC review process for any changes, which are not made lightly.    | Completely stable, all changes require a new version number and review process.                                                                 |
| Deprecated              | N/A        | A previous extension that has likely been superseded by a newer one or did not work out for some reason.                                                   | DO NOT USE, is not supported                                                                                                                    |

Maturity mostly comes through diverse implementations, so the minimum number of implementations
column is the main gating function for an extension to mature. But extension authors can also
choose to hold back the maturity advancement if they don't feel they are yet ready to commit to
the less breaking changes of the next level.

## Extending STAC

Anyone is welcome to extend STAC and evolve the additions into a full STAC extension with a README, JSON Schema and examples.
There are several types of extensions, some just add additional fields,
some change the behavior of STAC and some introduce completely new functionality. New extensions should try to align
with existing extensions as well as possible and may even re-use fields and their definitions until they may get split
into a new extension that combines commonly used fields across multiple extensions.

### General Conventions

Creating a new extension usually involves defining a set of logically grouped fields, and specifying what the allowed values
for those fields are. This should be done in the extension text (README) and in JSON Schema, to provide validation. While one 
can theoretically add fields anywhere in JSON there are some conventions as to where to add them in STAC objects.

1. Additional attributes relating to an [Item](../item-spec/item-spec.md) should be added into the Item Properties object,
   rather than directly in the Item object.
2. In general, additional attributes that apply to an Item Asset should also be allowed in Item Properties and vice-versa.
   For example, the `eo:bands` attribute may be used in Item Properties to describe the aggregation of all bands available in
   the Item Asset objects contained in the Item, but may also be used in an individual Item Asset to describe only the bands available in that asset.
3. Additional attributes relating to a [Catalog](../catalog-spec/catalog-spec.md) or
   [Collection](../collection-spec/collection-spec.md) should be added to the top-level of the object.
4. All other objects can generally also be extended, e.g. Link Objects, Provider Objects, Band Objects, etc.
5. Extensions may also extend other extensions, declaring that dependency in the text and JSON Schema.

### Proposing new extensions

Extensions can be hosted anywhere, but should use the
[extension template](https://github.com/stac-extensions/stac-extensions.github.io#using-the-stac-extensions-template) 
as a starting point. If you'd like to add a repository to the [stac-extensions](https://github.com/stac-extensions) 
GitHub organization, just ask on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby)! This is fine for 
work-in-progress extensions. You can also host the extension repository in your own GitHub account, and optionally 
transfer it to the stac-extensions organization later.

For new extensions that require community discussion, we recommend the following workflow:

- Use the stac-extensions template to sketch out your proposed extension
- Open an issue on this repository with the prefix "New Extension: " and describe the extension. Include a link to the extension repository.
  Also post it in the Gitter chat for broader recognition.
- Discussion should take place as issues/pull requests on the extension repository directly, but can als occur on the issue created before.
- Once the extension has an initial release, the issue on stac-spec will be closed.

### Prefixes

A STAC Item can combine schema information from several different sources - the core STAC Item information,
an earth observation community extension, and a vendor specific provider. It can be difficult to distinguish exactly where each definition
came from, and to pull out the most relevant information, especially when vendors often will dump in all the metadata they have in to the
STAC definition.

So one idea is to have prefixes to differentiate specific vendors (like `dg:` for DigitalGlobe), and for communities of practice
(like `eo:` for Electro-Optical). These wouldn't be full namespacing, though an extension for like JSON-LD could potentially
evolve to make fully resolved namespacing an option.

An example of this can be seen in a Landsat example:

```js
  "properties": {
    "datetime":"2018-01-01T13:21:30Z",

    "start_datetime":"2018-01-01T13:21:30Z",
    "end_datetime":"2018-01-01T13:31:30Z",

    "view:off_nadir": -0.001,
    "eo:cloud_cover": 10.31,
    "view:sun_azimuth": 149.01607154,
    "view:sun_elevation": 59.21424700,
    "gsd": 30,

    "l8:data_type": "L1T",
    "l8:wrs_path": 153,
    "l8:wrs_row": 25,
    "l8:earth_sun_distance": 1.0141560,
    "l8:ground_control_points_verify": 114,
    "l8:geometric_rmse_model": 7.562,
    "l8:image_quality_tirs": 9,
    "l8:ground_control_points_model": 313,
    "l8:geometric_rmse_model_x": 5.96,
    "l8:geometric_rmse_model_y": 4.654,
    "l8:geometric_rmse_verify": 5.364,
    "l8:image_quality_oli": 9
  }
```

### Use of arrays and objects

For extensions, it is recommended to

1. Use arrays only as enumerations/lists (possibly sorted), without implying additional meaning (such as order)
2. To avoid using nested objects, in favor of multiple attributes with a similar naming scheme.

For example, if one would like to define an extension to contain a start and a end date,
there are multiple options (tl;dr: option **3** is recommended):

1. Define an object, for example: `"date_range": {"start": "2018-01-01", "end": "2018-01-31"}`.
   This is **discouraged** as it is more complex to search in objects.
2. Define an two-element array where the first element is the start date and the second element is the end date,
   for example `"date_range": ["2018-01-01", "2018-01-31"]`.
   This is **discouraged** as it would conflict with Collection `summaries`,
   which always considers arrays as true (potentially sorted) enumeration without any additional meaning.
3. Define two separate fields, e.g. `"date_range_start": "2018-01-01", "date_range_end": "2018-01-31"`.
   This is **recommended** as it avoids the conflicts above and is usually better displayed in software that only understands GeoJSON
   but has no clue about STAC.
   This is due to the fact that most legacy software can not display arrays or objects GeoJSON `properties` properly.

This rules only applies to the fields defined directly for the Item's `properties`.
For fields and structures defined on other levels (e.g. in the root of an Item or in an array), extension authors can freely define the structure.
So an array of objects such as the `eo:bands` are fine to use, but keep in mind that the drawbacks mentioned above usually still apply.
